Verify **Travis-CI** passes on latest push to **Pull Request**\n * If broken, follow Steps 4 through 8 again\n11. **Merge Pull Request** on GitHub.com\n12. **Delete** `$feature` branch\n\n## Creating and Merging a Hotfix branch\n\n`$master` = _master_ Branch to merge into\n`$hotfix` = Branch with hotfix to merge\n`$develop` = _develop_ Branch to merge into\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Create new local `$hotfix` branch** from `$master`\n2. **Push / Publish** `$hotfix` branch\n3. Ensure **Pull Request** is created on GitHub.com\n * PR to merge `$hotfix` into `$master`\n * Set release milestone\n * Set proper labels\n   * Patch?\n * Set assignee (yourself, lead dev, or tester)\n4. Complete remaining development on `$hotfix` (if any)\n * **Commit / Push** additional changes to `$hotfix` as needed\n5. **Pull** `$master` **from remote**\n6. **Merge** `$master` **into** `$hotfix`\n7. **Commit** `$hotfix`\n8. **Push** `$hotfix`\n9. **Test** code again (to ensure `$master` or merge has not broken anything)\n * If broken, follow Steps 4 through 8 again (may want to also foll\n10. Verify **Travis-CI** passes on latest push to **Pull Request**\n * If broken, follow Steps 4 through 8 again\n11. **Merge Pull Request** on GitHub.com\n12. **Merge** `$hotfix` into `$develop`\n13. **Commit** `$develop`\n14. **Push** `$develop`\n15. **Delete** `$hotfix` branch\n\n## Releasing and tagging a new version\n\n1. **Merge** _develop_ **into** _master_\n2. **Tag** latest commit in master using the following format:\n * `{x}.x/{x.x.x}` (the .x is literal, like `3.x`)\n * Where **_{x}_** is the major release version (`2.x`)\n * Where **_{x.x.x}_** is the full release version (`2.5`)\n3. **Push all tags**\n\n## Further notes\n\nSome PHP IDEs and Git applications w/ UI support git-flow natively or through extensions. They will work great with this model, however working alongside the multiple versions (master vs 3.0 current; master vs 2.x in future) will **not** support the built-in master / develop / feature / hotfix / archive / release workflows for the secondary branching we've added to suit our needs.",

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Odoo Project Leads must have a Contributor License Agreement (the \"Agreement\") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project, its users, and the Odoo Project Leads; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.  If you have not already done so, please complete and sign the Agreement by:\n\n* following the electronic procedure to complete, sign and submit the ICLA at https://www.odoo.com/sign-cla\n* or scanning and emailing the signed Agreement to cla-submission@odoo.com\n\n**Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.**\n\nYou accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Project. Except for the license granted herein to the Project Leads and recipients of software distributed by the Project Leads, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.\n\n1. Definitions.  \n\"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.  \n\"Contribution\" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Leads for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products managed or maintained by the Project Leads (the \"Work\"). For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project Leads or their representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project Leads for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Leads and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Leads a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.\n\n\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Leads and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Leads a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n\n4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project Leads, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement with the Project Leads.\n\n\n5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.\n\n\n6.

The generation and parsing of the \n    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes \n    associated with the data types.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...\n    <resheader name=\"resmimetype\">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>\n    <resheader name=\"version\">2.0</resheader>\n    <resheader name=\"reader\">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>\n    <resheader name=\"writer\">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>\n    <data name=\"Name1\"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>\n    <data name=\"Color1\" type=\"System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing\">Blue</data>\n    <data name=\"Bitmap1\" mimetype=\"application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64\">\n        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>\n    </data>\n    <data name=\"Icon1\" type=\"System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing\" mimetype=\"application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64\">\n        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>\n        <comment>This is a comment</comment>\n    </data>\n                \n    There are any number of \"resheader\" rows that contain simple \n    name/value pairs.\n    \n    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a \n    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support \n    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. \n    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the \n    mimetype set.\n    \n    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the \n    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not \n    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:\n    \n    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format \n    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can \n    read any of the formats listed below.\n    \n    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64\n    value   : The object must be serialized with \n            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter\n            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.\n    \n    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64\n    value   : The object must be serialized with \n            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter\n            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.\n\n    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64\n    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array \n            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter\n            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.\n    -->\n  <xsd:schema id=\"root\" xmlns=\"\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:msdata=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata\">\n    <xsd:import
